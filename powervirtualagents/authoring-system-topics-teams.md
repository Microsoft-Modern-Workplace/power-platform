# Use system topics in Microsoft Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

System topics are common topics used in conversations with a bot.

You can't delete or disable system topics, or edit their trigger phrases. However, you can customize the nodes on the authoring canvas. We recommend that you don't customize these topics until you're comfortable creating an end-to-end bot conversation.

When you first create a bot, all system topics will be configured to trigger at the appropriate times. However you can manually trigger system topics by [redirecting](authoring-create-edit-topics-teams.md#redirect-to-another-topic) to them.

## System topics

The following diagram provides a visualization of how conversations flow through system topics.

The table below lists all available system topics and their intended purpose. It also provides a small sample of the built-in trigger phrases.

To see all trigger phrases for a system topic, [open the topic to view them in the trigger phrases pane](authoring-create-edit-topics-teams.md#create-a-topic).
