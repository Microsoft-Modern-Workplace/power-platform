See the [Licensing for Power Virtual Agents](../requirements-licensing-subscriptions.md) topic for a comparison and description of licenses.

To create and manage Power Virtual Agents chatbots in Teams, you need:

- [Licenses to use Power Virtual Agents](../requirements-licensing.md)

In some instances you may see a diamond icon or other indicator when a particular feature requires a different type of license. You'll be prompted about upgrading if you try to use that feature. For example, you'll see diamond icons when publishing to additional channels:
