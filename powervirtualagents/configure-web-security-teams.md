# Configure web and Direct Line channel security in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
>
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../configure-web-security.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](configure-web-security-teams.md)

You can configure advanced web channel security options with the Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a [Teams-only license, you can't generate secrets to enable secure access](../requirements-licensing-subscriptions.md). Secure access tokens are created automatically for you and secure access is enabled by default.

Read more about using [Configuring web channel security in the Power Virtual Agents web app documentation](../configure-web-security.md).
